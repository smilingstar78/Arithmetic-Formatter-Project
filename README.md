# 🧮 Arithmetic Formatter
### A freeCodeCamp Project

## 📜 Project Overview
The Arithmetic Formatter is a Python-based project that arranges basic arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) vertically, making them easier to read and solve. This project is designed to reinforce foundational programming concepts like string manipulation, input validation, and dynamic formatting.

## 🌟 Features
- Input Validation: Ensures that the provided problems contain valid numbers and operators.
- Dynamic Formatting: Aligns the arithmetic problems vertically for clarity.
- Optional Answer Display: Adds the solution beneath each problem when enabled.
- Supports Up to 5 Problems: You can format multiple problems side by side (with a maximum of 5).

## 📂 Files
**arithmetic_formatter.py** - The main Python script that formats the arithmetic problems.
**README.md** - You're reading it! A guide for understanding and using the project.

## ✅ Project Requirements (freeCodeCamp)
- Arrange arithmetic problems side-by-side, vertically aligned.
- Display only addition and subtraction problems.
- Optionally, display the answers.
- Handle errors for invalid input such as too many problems, invalid characters, or numbers that are too large.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Language: Python
- Platform: freeCodeCamp Project

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
- Mastery of string manipulation in Python
- Strong understanding of input validation and error handling
- Improved skills in dynamic formatting
